Call a11y_overlaysearch_button() -function anywhere in the theme and search will appear.

== Description ==

Accessible overlay search functionality. Supports Relevanssi and Polylang Pro.

== Polylang ==

Free version of Polylang won't show the correct live search results, since it doesn't support REST API.

If Polylang is enabled you need to add locale fallback to every language that has two part locale code e.g. sv_SE, de_DE etc. For example sv_SE locale fallback is sv_SE.
